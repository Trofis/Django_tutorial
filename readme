This is my first django starting project for beginners

--> DATABASE :

    How to create and implement the database (sqlite) ?
    1) When the model is done you can add the config in mysite/settings (ex : "polls.apps.PollsConfig")
    2) Then you can run the following command : python3 manage.py makemigrations polls
        - By running makemigrations, you’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models (in this case, you’ve made new ones) and that you’d like the changes to be stored as a migration
        - Migration = storing changes from our model (you can read it in "migrations" folder)
    3) Next you can run the following command : python3 manage.py sqlmigrate <app> <migration_number>
        - This command takes migrations and return them in SQL
        - python3 manage.py check can help you if you meet any kind of problem
    4) Finally run python3 manage.py migrate which takes all migrations in stand by and executes them


    python3 manage.py shell : gives you the possibility to interact with the free Django API (model, database, ...)
        - x = object(xx=.., ...) : initialize object
        - x.save() : save the object in the database
        - x.xx = yy : change value 
        - X.objects.all() = displays all the Model's objects
